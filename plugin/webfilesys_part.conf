# To use an alternative user manager instead of the built-in XML-based user manager, define the fully qualified class name of the 
# custom user manager class here (without the .class extension).
# For more information see the readme-src.txt file in the source directory.
# Example for the LDAP authenticated user manager contained in the WebFileSys distribution: 
# UserManagerClass=de.webfilesys.user.LdapAuthenticatedXmlUserManager
UserManagerClass=de.beas.DefaultValueUserManager
